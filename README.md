# Big Update

Now we're separating script that fetch detik news to new library, this repo use that new library.

Here's the library: [dn_scraper](https://pypi.org/project/dn-scraper/)

### Why we're doing this

We want to separate the library that fetch data and the interface like web api interface using flask that this repo demonstrate.

Now, you can grab the library and use that for the interface you like, maybe with FastApi, Django, or as Command Line Interface.
